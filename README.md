DESCRIPTION:
We will provide a platform where farmers can post details about their crops, like crop name, quantity, and the area where itâ€™s grown. Even members of  Panchayat can help in posting these details.  On the other hand, people from industries can order specific plants and crops and our system will search and provide them with the required quantity (if available). If anytime a crop is not available anywhere, industrial people can request for that crop along with the quantity required. On this farmers can bargain the price of the product directly with the industrial people. The industrial dealers then can give ratings and reviews on a crop received. This will determine the crop of which farmer will be displayed first to the dealer, ensuring a better crop quality from the farmer and fewer chances of cheating. These ratings and reviews will be a major factor for the farmers and the price of the crop decided by them.  The dealers themselves can review the ratings on a prop before ordering crop.
